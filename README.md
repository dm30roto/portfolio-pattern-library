# Portfolio Pattern Library

Starter kit pattern lab that can be used to build atomic designs. Use this as a base framework which you build on top of. This kit is different from the original Pattern Lab in that it includes a SASS compiler (gulp-sass) built in.

## Packaged Components

The Portfolio Pattern Library comes with the following components:

* `patternlab-node`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patternlab-node)
* `patternengine-node-mustache`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-node-mustache), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patternengine-node-mustache)
* `pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default)
* `pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default)

## Prerequisites

The Portfolio Pattern Lab Node uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) to run tasks and interface with the core library. Node version 4 or higher suffices. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the Node website if you haven't done so already. Installation of Node will include npm.

It also includes [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) to auto compile your SASS files as part of the `gulp patternlab` command.


## Installing

There are one method for downloading and installing the Portfolio Pattern Lab:

* [Use npm](#use-npm)

### Use npm

`npm` is a dependency management and package system which can pull in all of the Gulp Edition's dependencies for you. To accomplish this:

* download or `git clone` this repository to an install location.

* run the following

    ```
    cd install/location
    npm install
    ```

Running `npm install` from a directory containing a `package.json` file will download all dependencies defined within.

## Getting Started

The Portfolio Pattern Lab Node - Gulp Edition ships with a [base experience](https://github.com/pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-base) which serves as clean place to start from scratch with Pattern Lab.

## Helpful Commands

These are some helpful commands you can use on the command line for working with Portfolio Pattern Lab.

> Reminder: These commands assume a global installation of gulp 4.X, instead of a local installation. Depending on your preference, you may need to [upgrade your global version of gulp](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp/wiki/Updating-to-Gulp-4) or [run with local gulp](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Running-with-Local-Gulp-Instead-of-Global-Gulp).

### List all of the available commands

To list all available commands type:

    gulp patternlab:help
